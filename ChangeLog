      CHANGES IN PHYLOCH VERSION 1.0-1
		

BUG FIXES
    o fixNodes() did not work on some ladderized trees. This is
      (hopefully) now fixed, but users are still encouraged to 
      report any peculiarities. A this stage it might still be 
      good to doublecheck if a unknown tree is manipulated for the 
      first time. (Thanks to Ingo Michalak and Johan Nylander for
      bug report.)  

NEW FEATURES
    o This ChangeLog is included.
    o The stratigraphic chart 2012 is provided for axisGeo();
      see ?strat2012 for details. (Thanks to Lars Nauheimer for 
      providing the data frame).
